            <h1>Workflow</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>With the help of intelligent sensors, advance information technologies and IoT we have achived automation
                in warehouse management. </p>

        <h3>MQTT</h3>
        <hr>
        <section class="page-section">
            <p> With the use of MQTT Warehouse is easily managable across the globe. MQTT can scale to connect with
                millions of IoT devices. Many IoT devices connect over unreliable cellular
                networks. MQTTâ€™s support for persistent sessions reduces the time to reconnect the client with the
                broker. </p>
            <h4>Bi-directional Communications</h4>
            <p>MQTT allows for messaging between device to cloud and cloud to device. This makes for easy broadcasting
                messages to groups of things.</p>
        </section>
        <h3>Online Placer</h3>
        <hr>
        <section class="page-section">
            <p>This node is responsible for placing order on mqtt topic.</p>

        </section>
        <h3>Action Client</h3>
        <hr>
        <section class="page-section">
            <p>The Action Client subscribes to the topic /eyrc/vb/eTrzIron/orders for online orders and as soon as an
                order
                is placed on this mqtt topic, the action client updates the incomingOrders sheet of IMS
                and create a goal which contains order details and than this goal is sent to the Action server for
                further processing.
            </p>


        </section>
        <h3>Action Server And ur5_1 controller</h3>
        <hr>
        <section class="page-section">
            <p>This node recieves goals from the action client, this node uses the concept
                of threading to recieve multiple goals, the idea behind this is that the main thread
                will always be running and ready for recieving the goals, and an another thread which is
                "order_handler" thread is processing the goals seperately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now as when the very first goal is recieved it starts the order_handler thread.
                also this goal and all upcoming goals are recieving in main thread and these goals are
                seperated in different lists according to thier priority to process them later in order_handler thread.
            </p>
            <h4>2d Camera</h4>
            <p>This is responsible for mapping packages with their color.

                for mapping the colors we first take the image of all the pacakges and than crop this image so that only
                region
                of interest is present in cropped image than we use this cropped image to get qr_data.

                for eg, if we want the color of packagen00 we first take the image, now we know that packagen00 lies in
                a square made with points (100,300)[top left vertex](250,450)[bottom right vertex] so this is the region
                of interest for packagen00 now we crop this the image to get only region of interest [ROI] and send this
                cropped image with only packagen00 to function get_qr_data() which gives us the color of package00 now
                we map this color with box_name and details in a global lists according to their priority and using
                these lists while processing goal.</p>
            <h4>Main Thread</h4>
            <p>It is also updating the inventory sheet of the IMS. with the use of
                2d camera main thread detects the pacakges and save them in lists for further processing during
                dispatching and shipping.
                it seperates all the goals coming from the server in three critirea based on thier priority which is
                used by order_handler thread while processing the goals
            </p>

            <h4>order_handler thread</h4>
            <p>This thread is processing the goals but their is only one condition that the higher priority orders
                should be process first , for that we are first checking that if their is any high priority order
                to process if we got one than it is processed and if not it than checks for medium priority orders
                and these orders are saved in lists by main thread.
            </p>
            <p>Now for processing any certain goal at first it's priority is cheked and than we use the data of our
                inventory which is
                saved in a dictionary by 2d camera to get the position(row and col) of that particular package and than
                a saved trajectory
                to that position is sent to the ur5_1 to pick and place it on the conveyor belt and so the dipatching of
                the pacakge is done and this data is updated in ordersDispatched sheet of IMS and an email alert is sent
                to the user alerting that the order is dispatched.</p>

        <h3>ur5_2 Controller</h3>
        <hr>
        <section class="page-section">
            <h4>2d Camera</h4>
            <p>This is responsible for mapping packages with their color.

                for mapping the colors we first take the image of all the pacakges and than crop this image so that only

                these lists while processing goal.</p>
                <h4>Package detection</h4>
                <p>As the ur5_1 places a package on the conveyor belt this pacakge than come towards
                    ur5_2 and as soon as it reaches in the range of logical camera it is detected by the program
                    and stopped at a particular position (home position) and than ur5_2 grip the package, now package name as
                    detected by logical camera is used to retreive it's color form the data saved by the 2d camera and as we
                    get the color of the pacakge a saved trajectory to that color bin is sent to ur5_2 and than ur5_2 pick and
                    drops the pacakge in
                    desired bin and thus the pacakge is shipped and this data is updated in the orderShipped sheet of the IMS
                    and an email is sent to the user alerting that order is shipped.
