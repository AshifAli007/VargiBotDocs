      <p>The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, uses smart technology and real-time data to increase
        productivity and reduce costs.
        In smart factories, machinery, storage systems and production are capable of carrying out complex tasks,
        exchanging information and giving instructions to each other, without the need for human involvement.
        And stock management.

      </p>
      <p> Our
        project (Vargi -Bot) is all about industrial revolution which will
        Automate the Warehouse operations such as loading, unloading, picking, planning and more.</p>
    </section>
    <h3>Problems with current Warehouse Systems</h3>

    <section class="page-section">
      <h4>1. Inaccurate Inventory</h4>
      <p>Incomplete or inaccurate records often reveal themselves when a warehouse worker attempts to retrieve product
        from an expected location and it is not there or then they are directed to store product into a location that’s
        already full. Time and effort are wasted making physical checks and trying to correct error, often leading to
        delayed shipments and mis-picks.</p>

      <h4>2. Redundant Activities</h4>
      <p>The existence of unnecessary, excessive handling of product plagues many warehouses, with cases or pallets
        being moved through several intermediate locations. Often, though, redundant activities can be less obvious.
        Duplication of information and duplicate data entry are examples of major timewasters.</p>

      <h4>3. Poor Layout/Space Utilization</h4>
      <p>Achieving good space utilization has taken on new urgency with the rise of e-commerce. In fulfillment centers,
        there’s more movement and picking, increasing the cost of poor layout. Also, warehouse locations close to
        population centers often occupy more expensive land, which drives up costs.</p>

      <h4>4. High Labor Costs</h4>
      <p>Managers at distribution and fulfillment centers are under increasing pressure to reduce costs while improving
        service levels.Picking is still, for now, a highly manual task, although solutions continue to emerge. Consider
        how technology can increase pick rates and how pallet flow systems and AS/RS technology should be part of the
        solution</p>

    <h3>How Our Project Helps Revolutionize Our Industries</h3>
    <section class="page-section">
      <p>With the use of intelligent sensors and IoT we are capable of carrying out complex task, such as keeping the
        records of data and handling a large number of information in real time. </p>
      <h4>Real Time Information Managment</h4>
      <p>With the help of Cloud computing and Advances in Data Analytics We have the capapility to analyze all the
        information coming from manufacturing systems in real time.</p>
      <h4>Reduces Costs</h4>
      <p>The cost of managing the warehouse or factory will dramatically fall as a
        Result of our project by automation, system integration, data management, and more.
      </p>
      Primary drivers for these reduced costs include:
      <ul>
        <li>• Better use of resources</li>
        <li>• Faster manufacturing</li>
        <li>• Less machine and production line downtime</li>
        <li>• Lower overall operating costs</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Creates Innovation Opportunities</h4>
      <p>Industry 4.0 technologies give you greater knowledge of the manufacturing process, supply chains, distribution
        chains, business performance, and even the products you manufacture. This creates opportunities to innovate,
        whether that is changing a business process, developing a new product, optimising a supply chain, improving OEE,
        and more.</p>
      <h4>Increased Profitability</h4>
      <p>We will achieve this Industry 4.0 benefit through many of the points above including higher revenues with
        reduced costs.In addition, Industry 4.0 technologies enable us to produce higher quality, higher margin, and/or
        more innovative products. For example, Industry 4.0 technologies make it possible to offer customers
        personalised products while still using mass production methods to make those products.</p>

    <h3>How Our Project Works</h3>

    <section class="page-section">
      <p>The main focus of our project is to automate the operations of warehouse such as picking and sorting of the
        packages based on their priority. </p>

      <h4>Online Order Placement</h4>
      <p>As it is based on iot so the required package/order can be ordered online and the warehouse system is also
        connected using IoT so as soon as an order is placed the managment sytems become active and starts the
        processing.</p>
      <p>The records of order are saved in spread sheet and also a dashboard is used to see all the processes of
        warehouse systems in real time.</p>

      <h4>Warehouse System</h4>

      <p>With the use of IoT Warehouse system is capable of recieving the orders online
        so as soon as a package/order is recieved by this warehouse it checks the Inventory
        if the order quantity can be shipped or not and than it activates both the ur5 arms to
        complete the shipping process of desired package. As soon as the packages are dispatched or shipped this system
        is updating the order status online in a spreadesheet and user interactive Dashboard in real time.
        Both the ur5 arm uses intelligent sensors to detect the pacakges and sort them for shipping.
        It is aslo capable of taking multiple orders at a time but will process the higher priority packgages
        first. Thus reducing the time for the high priority orders to ship.
      </p>
